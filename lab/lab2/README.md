# Week 9, Lab 2 — Bootstrap

## Task

Build a static prototype based on the images in the [screens directory](./screens).
The goal is to create the basic structure of these pages, placing the correct
components into the page. For this assignment, you do not need to style the
application or make it match the screens visually.

### Required Components

Your prototype must contain all three of the following components:

- Dropdown
- Grid
- Modal

### Choose Your Own Components

Your prototype must contain your choice of five of the following components.

- Table
- Input Group
- Button Group
- Glyph Icon
- Label
- Alert
- Tooltip

### Stretch Goal

Keep going! Try to match all of the components. If you have additional time, can
you make the style look more similar to the screens?

### Extra Stretch Goal

Can you recreate the blue navigation on the left side of the screens?
